# OSVR-Unity Palace Demo

Project source hosted at: https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Unity-Palace-Demo

1) A recent build of [OSVR-Core](http://osvr.github.io/using/) is required to run this demo.

2) In the OSVR-Core Snapshot download, navigate to the bin folder to find:

osvr_server.exe -- this must be running for OSVR to work.

osvr_server_config.json -- this must be configured for your device. By default it will work with the HDK. See included examples in the bin and share folders for other configurations.

Add any [device plugins](http://osvr.github.io/using/) to the osvr-plugins-0 folder. 

3) Connect your device to and start osvr_server.exe, not necessarily in that order.

# RenderManager / DirectMode
OSVR-Unity supports Direct Mode, Timewarp, and Distortion Correction via OSVR RenderManager. Direct Mode requires Unity 5.2+ and NVIDIA graphics cards with the latest drivers* (364.xx drivers are not working at the time of this edit, revert to 362.00). NVIDIA specifies that a 700 series card or better is required, but our testing indicates that select lower cards may also be compatible. Tested and working on a 560M.
