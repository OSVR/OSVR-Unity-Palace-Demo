<h2>Is <code>OSVR-Core</code> the right repository?</h2>

<p>The OSVR system consists of a number of repositories, many of which are in the <a href="https://github.com/osvr">OSVR organization on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>OSVR-Core</code> repo consists of the core (native-code) libraries forming the base of the OSVR system, including the ClientKit and PluginKit C APIs and the C++ header-only wrappers. A basic console-style server application (<code>osvr-server</code>), examples of both the plugin and client APIs, development utilities, and some development documentation targeted at C and C++ users round out the mix of development and runtime components. Finally, some useful &ldquo;standard&rdquo; plugins that are licensed under the same terms as the rest of OSVR-Core are also included.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve got an issue to report, a bug fix, or a feature addition to those components: <strong>yes</strong>, you&rsquo;re in the right spot!</li>
<li>If you would like to contribute a plugin that can be licensed the same as the rest of the OSVR-Core and can be built cross-platform without many extra dependencies: <strong>most likely yes</strong>, this is the right place - if it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;ll help you find the right place.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve got a contribution to the OSVR-Unity integration, the OSVR-Unreal integration, or other game engine integration: <strong>you&rsquo;re close</strong> - see the <a href="https://github.com/osvr">org page</a> for a listing of repositories to find the one for your game engine integration.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve got a new game-engine integration: <strong>start by filing an issue here</strong>, we can get a repository set up for your new integration to move into.</li>
<li>If you have a hardware or software issue related to OSVR but aren&rsquo;t sure exactly where it fits: <strong>let us know with a support ticket at <a href="http://support.osvr.com">http://support.osvr.com</a></strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting ready</h2>

<p>General &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; instructions can be found at <a href="http://wiki.osvr.com">http://wiki.osvr.com</a>.</p>

<p>When making pull requests, please fork the project and create a topic branch off of the <code>master</code> branch.
(This is what GitHub does by default if you start editing with your web browser.)</p>

<p>When developing, make small commits that are nevertheless &ldquo;whole&rdquo;: small enough to review, but each containing a logical single change in its entirety.
(If you don&rsquo;t understand what we mean by this, that&rsquo;s OK, we&rsquo;ll work it out.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to rebase your topic branch to make the history more clear.
Avoid merging from master into your topic branch: if you need a change from master, rebase; otherwise, try to keep topic branches short-lived enough that we can get your code in to the mainline before much else changes!</p>

<p>Try to develop code that is portable (not particularly tied to a single operating system/compiler/etc) - OSVR runs on a number of platforms, and while we don&rsquo;t expect you to have all of them to test on, it&rsquo;s good to keep in mind. Our continuous integration server will be able to help with this.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re adding something reasonably testable, please also add a test.
If you&rsquo;re touching code that already has tests, make sure they didn&rsquo;t break.</p>

<p>There are code style guidelines - see the <code>[HACKING](hacking.md)</code> document for the details.
The main points are to match code surrounding what you&rsquo;re edited, and to be sure to use <code>clang-format</code>.
These help ensure that your changes are not artificially large because of whitespace, etc, that it&rsquo;s easy to review your changes, and that your code will be maintainable in the future.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that changes to PluginKit and ClientKit, particularly their headers, have the potential to impact (that is, break) a lot of downstream code (plugins, games), and break ABI, so changes in these areas will be more rigorously reviewed and discussed.
We&rsquo;d recommend opening an issue for discussion before you start coding on these areas, to make sure we&rsquo;ll be able to accept your contribution.</p>
